# Bill of Materials :zap:

This page will list everything you will need to design a micromouse. This design is based on the [Green Giant](http://greenye.net/Pages/Micromouse/Micromouse2012-2013.html).

## Primary Components
You need these components to enable the micromouse to sense its environment and
